How CB Subtitles Works
	You Upload a subtitle file and enter its name either on Video Uploading form or on Video Editing page and submit changes. File is moved to a directory called Captions inside your cb_root / files / 
	folder and stores data in database. Now whenever you go to watch that video for which you uploaded subtitles, it brings that data from database and takes files from directory and shows you options in 
	video player accordingly. 

	Note: Plugin only supports WebTTV (.vtt) subtitle file formats at the moment
